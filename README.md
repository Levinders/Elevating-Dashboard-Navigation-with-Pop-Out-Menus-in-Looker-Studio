# Enhancing Stakeholders Experience in Looker Studio Reports with Smart Pop-Out Menus and Navigations

## Project Motivation
In dashboard designs, visuals often steal the spotlight — but how users navigate the report is just as important. I recently explored the idea of:

* Maintaining one robust dashboard that contains analysis that can be easily accessed when needed, while
* Improving report users experince by building a pop-out menu navigation system in Looker Studio

The goal wasn’t to show data visuals, but to demonstrate how thoughtful navigation alone can significantly improve the user experience (UX) — especially in multi-page reports used by non-technical audiences.

## Key Features of What I Built
1. Pop-out Menus: Each section of the report becomes easily accessible — without overwhelming the user with multiple charts at once.
2. Web-like Navigation: Users can jump directly to specific insights or sections, reducing scrolling — easy to consume for non-technical users.
3. Clean, cohesive design, visual consistency, smooth transitions, and a themed layout that gives the dashboard a polished look 

## Business Value & Impact
In an actual data project, this navigation structure supports:
1. Faster decision-making for stakeholders as they will be able to find key metrics in <60 seconds, significantly improving meeting efficiency and reporting adoption.
2. Improved engagement from business users who may not be deeply technical, but still need to interact with the data as it gives a website like flow.
3. As additional metrics or analysis is needed, it can be added in a linked page, report remains organized and user-friendly — ideal for growing teams and evolving KPIs.
4. Ideal for multi-departmental business reports or teams (Sales, Operations, Support, Finance, HR, Marketing, etc)
