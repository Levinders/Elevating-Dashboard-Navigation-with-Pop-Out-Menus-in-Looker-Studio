## Project Motivation
In modern data projects, building dashboards that inform is not enough â€” they must also be intuitive, actionable, and user-friendly for a range of audiences. To meet that need, I developed an interactive pop-out menu navigation system in Looker Studio that elevates both the user experience (UX) and interface design (UI) of data reports.

The Challenge
Design a dashboard that:
Offers quick access to key metrics across multiple report sections
Minimizes visual clutter
Supports both high-level overviews and detailed drill-downs
Is intuitive for users with varying levels of data literacy


ðŸ’¡ Key Features
Pop-out Menus
Reduce visual clutter and allow users to focus on what matters. Each section of the report becomes easily accessible â€” without overwhelming the user with multiple charts at once.

Streamlined Navigation
Users can jump directly to specific insights or sections, reducing time spent scrolling or hunting for KPIs â€” a major win for both technical and non-technical users.

Clean, Cohesive Design
Visual consistency, smooth transitions, and a themed layout ensure the dashboard feels polished and easy to consume.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Value & Impact
In a real-world data project, this structure supports:
Faster decision-making for stakeholders, who can quickly scan and interpret insights relevant to them.
Improved engagement from business users who may not be deeply technical, but still need to interact with the data.
Scalability: As more metrics or pages are added, the report remains organized and user-friendly â€” making it ideal for growing teams and evolving KPIs.

Impact
Stakeholders (Non-technical):
Able to find key metrics in <30 seconds, significantly improving meeting efficiency and reporting adoption.

Analysts:
Can present segmented insights clearly, avoiding context switching during walkthroughs.

Scalability:
As new KPIs are added over time, the design can grow without compromising clarity or usability.
